//METHOD 1: use for loop decrementing a string
//1. empty string for new reversed # to enter 
//2. decrement using for loop 
//3. place value of newly iterated index # into newly create str 
//4. return new str 
//5. pass # or str you want into func 
//6. print new str to window to see output

var reverseNum = "";
//initiate new string to hold the reversed inputs

function reverseIt(num){
	for (var i = num.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	//starting point is set to one less than the length of str 'num', bc indices start at 0 (not 1). in this case, it is 8
	//as long as i is greater or equal to 0, 
	//decrement i after each iteration
		reverseNum += num[i];
		//add the index # of the element in whichever iteration of the loop
		//if we were to just do 'reverseNum += i', then we would get the INDEX NUMBER, not the element that the index number represents
	}
	return reverseNum;
}
//length of '123456789' is 9
//1st iteration:   i = (9 - 1) = 8,	reverseNum = "" + "9" = "9"
//2nd iteration:   i = (8 - 1) = 7,  	reverseNum = "9" + "8" = "98"
//3rd iteration:   i = (7 - 1) = 6,  	reverseNum = "98" + "7" = "987"
//4th iteration:   i = (6 - 1) = 5,	reverseNum = "987" + "6" = "9876"
//5th iteration:   i = (5 - 1) = 4,	reverseNum = "9876" + "5" = "988765"
//6th iteration:   i = (4 - 1) = 3,	reverseNum = "98765" + "4" = "9887654"
//7th iteration:   i = (3 - 1) = 2,	reverseNum = "987654" + "3" = "98876543"
//8th iteration:   i = (2 - 1) = 1,	reverseNum = "9876543" + "2" = "988765432"
//9th iteration:   i = (1 - 1) = 0,	reverseNum = "98765432" + "1" = "9887654321"
reverseIt('123456789');
window.document.write(reverseNum);

//METHOD 2: builtin methods split, reverse, and join

function reverseIt(word) {
	return word = word.split("").reverse("").join("");
	//split() method: returns array of individual elemnts in string
	//reverse() method: reverses elements in an array
	//join() method: joins all elements of an array into a str
