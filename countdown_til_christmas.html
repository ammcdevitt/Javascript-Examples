//calculates ms in a 24-hr day. hours * min * sec * ms, or 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 

xmasCountdown = Math.floor((xmasDateMS - currentDateMS)/(oneDayMS));
//1. subtract difference btwn Christmas date and today's date (now in ms), which returns difference in ms with ~11 digits
//2. divide by total ms in a day in order to get the number of DAYs not number of ms, which returns float with ~16 digits
//3. use floor to round the day down, so that we get an int back, eliminating all digits after the decimal

window.document.write(xmasCountdown + " days til Christmas!");
